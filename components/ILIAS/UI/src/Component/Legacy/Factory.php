     *     This component is used to wrap an existing ILIAS UI element into a
     *     UI component.
     *     This is useful if a container of the UI components needs to contain
     *     content that is not yet implement in the centralized UI components.
     *   composition: >
     *     The legacy component contains html or any other content as string.

     *     1: >
     *       This component MUST only be used to ensure backwards compatibility
     *       with existing UI elements in ILIAS,
     *       therefore it SHOULD only contain Elements which cannot be generated
     *       using other UI Components.
