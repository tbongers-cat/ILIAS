 *   Example for rendering a vimeo video player.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a base video player with a vimeo video including all functions like stop/start icons. The subtitle
 *   symbol (CC) is missing. Clicking the Start/Stop symbol will start playing the video. Clicking the symbol again will
 *   stop the video.
 *
 *   In addition following functions have to be tested:
 *   - The video starts playing if clicking the start/stop symbol in the middle of the image. The video stops after another click.
 *   - The sound fades or raises if the volumes gets changed by using the volume control.
 *   - Clicking the full screen icon maximizes the video player to the size of the desktop size. Clicking ESC will diminish the video player.
