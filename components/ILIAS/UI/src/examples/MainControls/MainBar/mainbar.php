 * ---
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a link "Full Screen Page Layout".
 *   On clicking the link, a new page opens. The mainbar on the new page is
 *   initially closed.
 *
 *   MainBar is big component; the page shows some of its features:
 *   "Tools": >
 *      The Tools-entry is differently colored than the rest of the entries.
 *      Clicking it will open the slate and reveal the tools "Help", "Editor"
 *      and "Closeable Tool". Each of them are clickable and will alter the
 *      slate's content when clicked.
 *      The "X" will remove the "Closeable Tool" from the tools-section.
 *    "Repository": >
 *      The slate in "Repository" is filled with a lot of entries to demonstrate
 *      the vertical scrollbar within it.
 *    "Personal Workspace": >
 *       will contain two entries "Bookmarks", which will open sub-entries (links)
 *       rather than changing the content of the page.
 *    "Organisation": >
 *      There is a larger sub-structure of further slates in "Organisation".
 *      Higher slates ("1") will close all lower levels(1.1, 1.2), but will
 *      re-open to the state the user left the substructure.
 *
 *   Clicking an opened entry will close the slate.
 *   Re-opening will have the state of the substructure preserved.
