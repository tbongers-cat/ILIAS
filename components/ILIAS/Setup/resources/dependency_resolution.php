// This is the default resolution for ambiguous dependencies of components in

// The structure is as such: keys are components that use services ("dependant")
// that need disambiguation, the value for each dependant is an array where the key
// is the definition ("dependency") and the value is the implementation
// ("implementation") to be used.
//
// The entry "*" for the dependant will define fallbacks to be used for all components
// that have no explicit disambiguation.
